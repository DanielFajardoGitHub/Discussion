# Discussion (and announcements!) happen in this repo

If you have problems, issues, or have any questions during the semester, create a thread here under the [issues](/issues) tab. You can tag your peers and GitHub will get their attention. E.g. @donbowen for me, @danielappierto for the TA, and similarly for your classmates individually or as a group. 

_**Click on the Watch button in the top so that you get announcement notfications and see issue discussions automatically.**_
